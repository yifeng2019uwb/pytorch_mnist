This project to design and describle a full CI/CD pipeline for a Python application with pytorch mnist component. 

What is CI CD Pipeline?
A CI/CD pipeline is the practical implementation of DevOps principles. Below is a brief overview of what CI/CD stands for. 

Continuous Integration (CI) means using automation tools to build, test and merge code seamlessly. This is to ensure that code coming from different developers and components is free of errors. Automated tests help spot bugs at the early stage of software development and fix them immediately

Continuous Delivery (CD) is the practice of releasing software in short cycles, with greater speed and frequency. New code is released in smaller batches, even a few times a day. This makes it more bug-resistant and easier to manage.

CD also means Continuous Deployment, or the constant and automated production deployment of every change made to the code, ideally without any human intervention. This is Continuous Delivery taken to a new level of automation.
